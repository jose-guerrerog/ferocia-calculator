# Ferocia Calculator

A simple compound interest calculator built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Material UI**.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript)
- **UI**: MUI (Material UI)
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

---

## How It Works

The app uses the compound interest formula:

A = P Ã— (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- **A** = Final amount
- **P** = Start amount
- **r** = Annual interest rate (decimal)
- **n** = Number of compounding periods per year (based on frequency)
- **t** = Term in years

If "Interest Paid" is set to **maturity**, the calculator uses **simple interest** (not compounding during the term).
